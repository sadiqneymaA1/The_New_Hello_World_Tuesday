# Overview

I created a ping pong game using python language. The left bat is controlled by 

 (paddle_left_up,"w")

 (paddle_left_down,"s")

 The left bat is controlled by 

(paddle_right_up,"Up")

(paddle_right_down,"Down")

Players have to try to avoid letting the ball pass their bats else their opponents gain points over them.
